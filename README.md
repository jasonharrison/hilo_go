## hilo_go 

A simple game where the player tries to guess a randomly selected number. After each guess, the application tells the player if their guess is too high or too low. This is repeated until the player guesses the correct number.

`main.go` demonstrates [structs](https://www.golang-book.com/books/intro/9#section1) and [methods](https://www.golang-book.com/books/intro/9#section2), generating random numbers using [math/rand](https://golang.org/pkg/math/rand/), and reading console input with [bufio](https://golang.org/pkg/bufio/).

`main_test.go` demonstrates testing using the [testify](https://github.com/stretchr/testify) toolkit.
